Steps:

1 ) Traffic controler:

0. Copy paste traffic controler.cc from traffic control folder in example
1. Remove void
2. Change to device01, add node.Get(0), node.Get(1). And copy it again and change to 12
3. Remove 10 lines from the last line of step 2
4. Change to interface01, device 01 and 10.1.1.0 and similarly for interface12, device12, 10.1.2.0
5. In Flow, change to nodes.Get(1), rmt (interface12, GetAdress(1)..)
6. In Flow onoff....nodes.Get(0))
7. Delete from unit32...( Below []rxByets...) Till simulator. And after simulator to till return 0
8. Go to tutorial folder, in third.cc scroll down till end. Copy the Ipv4Global.... And past it above the Flow in abc.cc
9. From third.cc copy unit32....(above []rxByets) to endl (9 lines) and paste above return 0
10. Change "Tcp" to "Udp" in int main() of if-statement
11. nodes.Create(3) below if-else statement of int main()

Run it: 
1. Open cmd in that folder >>cd ..
2. ./waf --run abc
3. ./waf --run abc --vis
4. Write down the 4 values


2 ) Dancing one

0. Tutorial - third.cc , rename it abc.cc
1. From traffic control.cc copy the last #include... And paste in abc.cc
2. Delete from UdpEchoServer to last 3 lines simulator
3. Copy the Flow from traffic control.cc to endl (make sure till there is a if statement or 10000..etc) paste above those 3 lines
4. Change in Flow - change (socketType...), (nodes.Get(..)) And below tht (simulationTime+0.1) to ("ns3::UdpSocketFactory"...), (csmaNodes.Get(...)) and (10+0.1)
5. There is one more (socketType...) Change it to ("ns3::UdpSocketFactory"...), And below paragraph code change (interfaces...) To (csmaInterfaces...), (nodes.Get(..)) to (csmaNodes.Get(...)), change below 2 (simulationTime+0.1) to (10+0.1)
6. Copy Ipv4Global.... From third.cc and paste above Flow

Run it:
1. cd ..
2. ./waf --run abc --vis


3) Graph one

0. Examples - Tcp - Tcp comparison.cc
1. Copy n paste it in scratch and rename it to abc.cc
2. Examples - Traffic controler - traffic control.cc, copy the all #includes... From this file and paste it in abc.cc
3. In abc.cc int main() change "TcpWestWood" to "TcpReno", bool tracing and flow_monitor: false to true
4. Run it : cd .., ./waf --run abc, we will get many files in folder, just keep cwnd, rtt, ASCII, ssth and delete rest all files
5. Copy values from cwnd file and plot graph in Libre office



4) 4 nodes (red balls)

0. Examples - wireless - wifi-sample-adob.cc, copy and paste in scratch and change its name to abc.cc
1. Change c.Create(2) to c.Create(4)
2. There will be 2 lines of 
positionAlloc -> addVector(0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0) 
positionAlloc -> addVector(5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0) 

Copy paste them again to make 4 lines and changes applied 

positionAlloc -> addVector(0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0) 
positionAlloc -> addVector(5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0) 
positionAlloc -> addVector(10.0,5.0,0.0,0.0) 
positionAlloc -> addVector(15.0,5.0,0.0,0.0) 

3. From traffic control.cc copy all the #includes and paste it
4. Flow from traffic control.cc till endl; (that above if statement, before unit32) and paste it before simulator
5. From copied Flow change all the simulationTime to 10, (interfaces,...) To (i,...), (nodes.Get(..)) To (c.Get(...)) And (socketType,...) To ("UdpSocketFactory',..) do these changes to all 

Run it:
1. cd ..
2.  ./waf --run abc --vis
