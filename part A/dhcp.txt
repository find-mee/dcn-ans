a)UDP
b)DHCP Message Type
 Request includes a server identifier field
c)1st set of messages: 0x6fd4f5bb
 2nd Set of messages: 0x53a63280
 Purpose: The transaction ID is different so that the 
 host can differentiate between different requests made by the user
d)Discover: 0.0.0.0/255.255.255.255
  Offer: 192.168.1.1/255.255.255.255
  Request: 0.0.0.0/255.255.255.255
  ACK:192.168.1.1/255.255.255.255
e) 192.168.1.1
f) My client is offered 192.168.1.10 by the DHCP server.
   The offer message contains the DHCP address offered by the server
g) In the example given, the value that indicates there is no relay agent is 0.0.0.0,
   in the case of my capture, I also have a value for the relay agent of 0.0.0.0 indicating 
   that I too did not have a relay agent
h) The purpose of lease time is to tell the client how long they can use the specific IP address 
   assigned by the server before they will have to be assigned a new one.
   The lease time in my experiment is 86400 seconds or 1 day
i) The purpose of the release message is to release the IP address back to the server.
   There is no verification that the release message has been received by the server.
