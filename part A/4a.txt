4) http

Steps

Answer:
a) See carefully. like 1.1
b) en-US
c) 200 OK 
d) We can filter
messages by http.last_modified and we see that the HTTP response I received for the html
1 file doesn’t show this field. We do have a http.last_modified field in the favicon response
however, . This says the favicon was last modified on Feb 25, 2010
e) Content-length = 209 bytes.
f) No
g)  See screenshot of response with Alice’s Adventures...
h) Yes
i) As seen in the
   previous screenshot, we get a HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified Response.
   This is much shorter than the full response packet seen previously 
   which contained all of Alice in Wonderland.
