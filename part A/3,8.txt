sudo su
Enter passw
Type 'wireshark'
Capture
Click on Start

Terminal 2

In wireshark Stop it (Red)
Filter 'icmp' 
Answer the questions

Answers:
a) 172.217.174.68
b) ICMP
c) Header bytes: 20 
   Payload bytes: 36 (total length 56 - 20 header bytes = 36)
d) we do not see any IPv4 fragments
   Dont fragment: 1, more Fragment: 0, Cannot be fragmented
e) Identiﬁcation ﬁeld is incrementing
   Time to live is also incrementing, Header file checksum
f) 
• version (IPv4 always used)
• header length (doesn’t change since we are always using IPv4)
• source IP (my computer’s IP address doesn’t change)
• destination IP (usc.edu’s IP address doesn’t change)
• diﬀerentiated services (same protocol every time)
• upper layer protocol (same protocol every time)
• header checksum (veriﬁcation disabled in my tests)
g) Yes
h) The Flags bit for more fragments is set, indicating that the datagram has been
fragmented. Since the fragment offset is 0, we know that this is the first
fragment. This first datagram has a total length of 1500, including the
header.
i)We can tell that this is not the first fragment, since the fragment offset is
1480. It is the last fragment, since the more fragments flag is not set.
The IP header fields that changed between the fragments are: total length,
flags, fragment offset, and checksum.
