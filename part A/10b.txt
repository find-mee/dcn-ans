a) My browser only sent 1 HTTP GET request to the server. 
   The Packet that contained the GET message was packet number 233.
b) The data was sent in 5 TCP segments to the browser, then reassembled
c)
d) My browser sent 3 http GET message requests. One each to each for each of the following: The initial page, the Pearson logo, and the cover of the Pearson book, 5th Edition.
Initial Page address: 128.119.245.12
Pearson Logo: 165.193.140.14
Pearson book, 5th Edition: 128.119.240.90
e) The browser downloaded the two images in serially. 
I believe this to be the case because the first image was requested 
and sent before the second image was requested by the browser. 
Had they been running in parallel, both files would have been requested then would have returned in the same time period. In this case however,
 the second image was only requested after the first image came back.
f)The servers intial response was “401 Authentication Required”
g)The new field that is now included is the authorization field.
 This is included because we sent the server a username and password along
 with our request stating that we were authorized to receive the page.
